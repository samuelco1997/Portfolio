This project was meant to showcase proficiency with data analysis in R. The "Covid_Analysis" R Markdown file contains my code, while the COVID data ("OxCGRT_latest.csv" and "USstates.xlsx") can be found in the main directory of this folder. A HTML version of the code output can also be found in this folder ("Covid Data Analysis"). 

The other R files in this notebook contain information and data used in the Covid_Analysis file
