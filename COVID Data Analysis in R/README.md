This project was meant to showcase proficiency with data analysis in R. The "Covid_Analysis" R Markdown file contains my code, while the COVID data ("OxCGRT_latest.csv," "USstates.xlsx," "Ch7_Exercise1_Instability.RData," and "Ch7_Exercise4_PostTreatmentSimulation.R") can be found in the "Data" folder. A HTML version of the code output can also be found in this folder as well ("Covid Data Analysis"). 

The analysis is divided into 3 parts:
1) **Setup**: Reading in data
2) **Exploratory Analysis**: Cleaning, merging, and data visualizations
3) **Hypothesis Testing**: Regression analysis, including bivariate, multivariate, logged, and scaled regressions
