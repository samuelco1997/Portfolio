In this project for my Data Science II class, I created models that could classify instances of electoral violence using decision tree and random forest algorithms. The target variable was "electoral_vio_uncertainty," measuring the likelihood of an event being classified as electoral violence. All of the data used to perform this analysis and classification can be found in the main directory of this folder. Please run the Python notebooks in the following order:

1) DSII_FinalProject_**Preprocessing**
2) DSII_FinalProject_**Exploratory Data Analysis**
3) DSII_FinalProject_**Results**

No change in directory is required if the folder is downloaded as is (there are universal paths). If you would like to see what the output of these scripts looks like without downloading and running the files, please navigate to the "HTML" sub-folder. 

A full report and slide deck on this project, along with a codebook for the data, can be found in the "Report" sub-folder.
