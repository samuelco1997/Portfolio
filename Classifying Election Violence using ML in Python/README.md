# Classifying Election Violence using ML in Python

In this project for my Data Science II class, I created models that could classify the likelihood of instances of electoral violence using random forest algorithms. The target variable here is "electoral violence uncertainty," measuring the likelihood of an event being classified as electoral violence. 

### Code
All of the data used to perform this analysis and classification can be found in the main directory of this folder. No change in directory is necessary if the folder is downloaded as is. For replication, please run the Python notebooks in the following order:

1) DSII_FinalProject_**Preprocessing**
2) DSII_FinalProject_**Exploratory Data Analysis**
3) DSII_FinalProject_**Results**

### Data
Data can be found in the "Data" folder in this repository. It contains the raw and cleaned data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (DECO), as well as other indicators used for this analysis from the World Bank's World Development Indicators website.

### Report
A full report and slide deck on this project, along with a codebook for the data, can be found in the "Report" folder.
