For this project in my Neural Networks class, I attempted to create a dog whistle classification system using LLM-generated word embeddings from the DistilBERT transformer in combination with traditional supervised learning techniques, namely K-Nearest Neighbor and Logistic Regression. This folder contains all of the files and data necessary to carry out this process. The code should be run in the following order:

**1) DW_EDA_&_Cleaning**
**2) DW_Modeling**

Please not that there are two raw data sets being used: reddit comments containing dog whistles ("silent_signals_dw"), and reddit comments that do not. Because the latter was to large to upload to this repository, I have provided a link in the folder ("RS_2013-12.jsonl")
