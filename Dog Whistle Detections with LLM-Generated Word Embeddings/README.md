For this project in my Neural Networks class, I attempted to create a dog whistle classification system using LLM-generated word embeddings from the DistilBERT transformer in combination with traditional supervised learning techniques, namely K-Nearest Neighbor and Logistic Regression. Results were compared with simple Word2Vec embeddings. 

This folder contains all of the files and data necessary to carry out this process. The code should be run in the following order:

**1) DW_EDA_&_Cleaning**  - Exploratory Analysis and Data Cleaning

**2) DW_Modeling** - Training the models

Please not that there are two raw data sets being used: reddit comments containing dog whistles ("silent_signals_dw"), and reddit comments that do not. Because the latter was to large to upload to this repository, I have provided a link in the folder ("RS_2013-12.jsonl")
