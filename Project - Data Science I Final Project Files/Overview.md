### This Project

This folder contains material from a group final project for my graduate school Data Science I class. For this project, our group analyzed Youtube comment and video data regarding shocking news events. Data was collected using the Youtube API, and a Hugging Face model was used to generate sentiment analysis for each comment. The file Python file that I have included here ("_ds_final_project_analysis.ipynb") includes my own data cleaning, analysis, hypothesis testing, and visualization. A full report on the analysis itself ("Data Science I - Final Project Essay") can also be found 
in this folder as well.
