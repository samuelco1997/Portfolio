Editor's Note: My edits were all made to keep the video on one, central topic by editing together relevant commentary from many parts of Hasan's streams to create a storyline that is still followable by the viewer. I also edited in commentary of my own in places, in addition to relevant external information that improves the viewing experience. A lot of edits were made for comedy purposes, or to enhance the comedic timing of certain beats, but never to misrepresent Hasan's point of view.

A parent should never outlive their child.
Trageties like this should never happen.
& songs like this shouldn't exist. 

That being said, as a songwriter, after hearding the news (like the every other parent out there) my heart broke, & that energy was then channeled into a song. 

I can only hope that it will help those who need it, and we all remember to hold our little ones a little tighter tonight.

Texas gubernatorial candidate Beto O‚ÄôRourke interrupted the state governor‚Äôs press conference on Wednesday, May 25, one day after a mass shooting left 21 people dead in Uvalde, Texas.
Video taken by Carlos Eduardo Espina shows O‚ÄôRourke approaching the stage where Texas Gov Greg Abbott was holding a press conference on Tuesday afternoon.
‚ÄúGovernor, I have to say something,‚Äù O‚ÄôRourke can be heard saying in the footage. ‚ÄúThe time you needed to have stopped this was after Santa Fe High School.‚Äù
Abbott and others onstage engaged verbally with O‚ÄôRourke, telling him to ‚Äúsit down‚Äù and ‚Äúleave,‚Äù with one calling him a ‚Äúsick son of a b***h.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing nothing. You‚Äôre all doing nothing ‚Ä¶ this is totally predictable when you choose not to do anything,‚Äù O‚ÄôRourke said.
‚ÄúThis is on you until you choose to do something different. This will continue to happen,‚Äù O‚ÄôRourke said as he was ushered away from the stage. ‚ÄúSomebody needs to stand up for the children of the state, or they will continue to be killed just like they were killed in Uvalde yesterday.‚Äù
The press conference was streamed live to the governor‚Äôs Facebook page for only 35 seconds before the stream ended.
O‚ÄôRourke, a Democrat, is running against Abbott, a Republican, in Texas‚Äôs gubernatorial election in November.
Nineteen students and two adults were killed on May 24 after an 18-year-old local resident pushed past officers and barricaded himself inside a fourth grade classroom at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, according to officials‚Äô latest updates.

""There was blood in the hallway and children were covered in it, one of the students who survived the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, told ABC News.

""[The shooter] came in and said, 'You're all gonna die,' and just started shooting,"" Samuel Salinas, 10, recalled in an interview airing Friday on ""Good Morning America.""

Salinas was a student in Irma Garcia's fourth-grade class. They were scheduled to graduate Thursday, but the ceremony was canceled because Garcia, another teacher and 19 third- and fourth-grade students were killed in Tuesday's massacre. Another 17 people were wounded, including three law enforcement officers.

The gunman, Salvador Ramos, allegedly purchased two assault rifles just days after turning 18 and used them to carry out the second-worst school shooting in U.S. history, killing 21 people, according to authorities.

Some of the children and teachers who walked into school that day had no idea it would be their last.""

Storyful Viral,UC5ovaFtNA0Jbq7mf0vdKYjg,1653731943.0,Texas Governor Abbott Says He Was 'Misled' About Uvalde Shooting,"Texas Governor Abbott Says He Was 'Misled' About Uvalde Shooting
Texas Governor Greg Abbott said on May 27 that he was initially ‚Äúmisled‚Äù in the aftermath of the shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, as authorities in the state came under intense criticism for failing to act sooner to stop the attack.
‚ÄúI was misled,‚Äù said Abbott, referring to remarks he made following the May 24 shooting, which he said were based on briefings he‚Äôd been just been given. ‚ÄúAs everybody has learned, the information that I was given turned out, in part, to be inaccurate, and I am absolutely livid about that.‚Äù
After days of uncertainty around the law enforcement response in Uvalde, authorities on Friday revealed that students made a series of 911 calls over more than an hour as they awaited rescue. Up to 19 officers were in a hallway outside a classroom where the shooter, Salvador Ramos, had holed up, but made no effort to incapacitate him.
Abbott had earlier praised the response of law enforcement officers, saying on Wednesday that ‚Äúit could have been worse‚Ä¶ The reason it was not worse is because law enforcement officials did what they do.‚Äù
After the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, law enforcement moved towards response plans that aimed to incapacitate any shooter as soon as possible, and not wait for backup. In Uvalde, officials now admit officers on the scene did not follow that strategy.

Senate Republicans recently voted down a bill intended to combat what Democrats say is a rise in domestic terrorism, noting the bill constituted the creation of ‚Äúthought police‚Äù offices within federal agencies. On a deeper level, however, the arguments for the bill were based on a false pretense that a recent mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, was done by a ‚Äúfar-right extremist.‚Äù In reality, the shooter appeared to be a far-left National Bolshevist, as have others. We invite Trevor Loudon, host of Counterpunch and author of ‚ÄúEnemies Within,‚Äù to explain this.

In other news, another mass shooting recently took place in Uvalde, Texas, where a man shot and killed 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school. The tragedy is being used politically by Democrats to advance an agenda against firearms, yet emerging information has undermined a central argument to the gun control narrative‚Äîthat firearms are not needed for defense, when police provide this as a service‚Äîsince police waited nearly an hour to stop the shooter, out of fear for their own safety.

In this live Q&A with Crossroads host Joshua Philipp, we‚Äôll discuss these stories and others, and answer questions from the audience.

Church with Jesse Lee Peterson, Sunday, May 29, 2022: We discuss at-length people's reaction to the Uvalde, Texas school shooting. Satan feeds the imagination to get you emotional: ""What if it were your kids?"" People talk about the attacks on the Second Amendment as well as trauma from ""bullying"" and ""abuse."" Jesse then asks: Are you living in a natural or unnatural state? Know yourself by knowing the not-you. Be in the world, but not of it, not moved by others. Don't identify with your children. We close with the Biblical Question: Do you dance to your own music?

She had a message for President Biden and the Media which she shared with us.

""We need to stop putting each other down"" 

Nicole was in the school and she saw the shooter who she doesn't want to adress by his name ""he does not deserve it and he is the only one I blame"".

She got upset when someone said Uvalde police are pussies ""They saved me, they were in the building when shooter shot at my door"".

She went into details about what she saw inside the school, police response and about what their community needs from people.

Her daughter Trinity who is in high school explained that their community is very small and people need to understand that, they need unity.

PRC Podcast,UC96irjgH_0WT42AMxtCHISQ,1653904650.0,PLEASE REMAIN CALM PODCAST EPISODE 82: THE UVALDE SHOOTING,"We talk about the horrific elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. Not just the details of the event, but what its like to respond to shootings with kids, shootings with multiple victims, active shooter situations, & the PTSD for the first responders that work these scenes. We talk about what its like to work in the neighborhood you grew up in, or still live in. The risk of having to treat your immediate family members. The fear of possibly making a mistake with someone you know personally on a 911 call. What if you have to triage a mass shooting, telling parents theres nothing you can do, & moving on to try to save more kids. What about finding out your own child died at the incident you're working at? We also get into the challenges leading up to this event, the respose, timeline, everything including how we feel as parents.

The National Rifle Association decided to hold their convention anyway, creating outrage and protests. Some of the entertainers cancelled out of respect for the families, others, like President Trump, spoke at the meeting. Was it right for the NRA to hold a gun convention following a mass murder of 19 children? Are they right, or evil? Do they really care about how these parents feel? Or should they have gone about business as usual? (which is what they did) Gun control is back in the news, and we've all heard the pundits weigh-in this week. I want to know what YOU think. I was one of the first people to go on MSNBC after the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012 and debate gun control with David Corn (Mother Jones Magazine) and Michael Smerconish. (former MSNBC/current CNN host) After the show I recieved multiple death threats. Now, 10 years later, the problem is even worse. Watch this short (4-minute) video and please weigh-in on what you think is the answer. The politicians aren't mature enough to engage in robust, respectful debate, but we certainly can.

The Reload,UCeELv8EXoLjf0721lEF4fcg,1653922829.0,Q&A on the NRA Annual Meeting and Fallout From the Uvalde Shooting | Full Podcast,"Read more of our reporting here: https://thereload.com/

With so much going on this week, it felt like the appropriate time to do another Q&A episode.

Contributing Writer Jake Fogelman joined me to answer some of the most pressing questions from Reload Members. With the NRA Annual Meeting taking place in Houston, Texas just a few days after a horrific school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, there is a lot to discuss.

Members wanted to know how gun owners can best respond to attacks like this. What are some policy solutions? What's the best way to avoid bad-faith fights without completely ceding the conversation to the loudest voices? Could the Uvalde or Buffalo attacks have been prevented under our current laws?

There were also several questions about the state of the NRA and the gun-rights movement at large. How bad have things gotten at the NRA? Are other gun-rights groups able to fill whatever gaps the NRA's struggles have created? What lies ahead?

We answer those questions and more.",25,184,3,13,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bLVhHzDTLUI/hqdefault.jpg,,2023-11-29 12:26:19.225337,7,2022-05-30,2022-05-30 15:00:29
Gregory Wong,UCbHCssfP5m9LSp-ozmcZXvg,1653937310.0,"UVALDE SHOOTING  As a grandfather, I send my condolences to all victims  & offer this as my prayer‚Ä¶","Dear friends,
Ôªø
ÔªøListening to the news when returning home from church this Sunday, the death of the 21 people, mostly kids, put me into deep sorrow.   Being an Asian coming from Hong Kong, I always feel sad when hearing people got killed by gunshots.  This time is particularly shocking as 19 of them were young kids, in their golden age.  Looking at the heartbreaking parents in TV, I can totally understand their pain and anger, being a grandfather of 4 grandchildren from 7 to 12.  Just thinking if this happens to them will make me shiver and drive me crazy.  I know I can do nothing to help, not even a hug to each of their family members to show my concern and send my condolences.  But I remember I just played a piece in church, the Consolation #3, and nothing is more meaningful than this as my prayer to show my deepest sympathy and sorrow.  Let‚Äôs pray and may God show mercy to them all and let the kids and their teacher, follow the last note, rest in eternal peace.
P.S. The piece is not playing too well in normal standard and hope you all don‚Äôt mind.  I am praying with my heart even though I have never learnt piano.",22,176,2,4,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_nLTeNeTnA8/hqdefault.jpg,,2023-11-29 12:26:19.225337,7,2022-05-30,2022-05-30 19:01:50

I WANT TO BE COMPLETELY CLEAR, VIEWS ARE HYPOTHETICAL AND BASED UPON OBSERVATION AND CUMULATIVE SPECULATION. ONE THING IS FOR SURE THEM KIDS REALLY DIED THERE AND I WILL NOT TAKE THAT FROM THEM FAMILIES WHO LOST SOMEBODY THERE THAT DAY. IM NOT ALEX JONES. BUT I KNOW THEM FAMILIES IS ALSO VERY SKEPTICAL AS TO THINGS THAT ARE ATTEMPTING TO BE EXPLAINED OR BRIBED AWAY AS WE SPEAK. BUT I WILL NEVER INVALIDATE THE LIVES THAT WERE STOLEN FROM YALL IN UVALDE. I WILL NOT TRY AND INVALIDATE A PAIN I CANT IMAGINE GOING THRU...N IM SORRY I HAVE TO MAKE COMMENTARY ON IT, I GOTTA EAT THO. HOWEVER I PROMISE TO ALWAYS GO ABOUT MY CONTENT IN THE MOST PROFESSIONAL, AND RESPECTFUL WAY POSSIBLE AND GIVE THE FACTS ALONG WITH MY ANALYSIS, THEORIES AND HYPOTHESIS SURROUNDING SUCH EVENTS....I PROMISE TO ALWAYS BE FAIR, BALANCED AND ASK THE TOUGH QUESTIONS WITHOUT HURTING ANYBODY FEELINGS OR INVALIDATING THEM. AND I PROMISE TO KEEP ALL COMMENTARY IN A NEUTRAL WAY THAT IS NEVER SNITCHING, I WILL NEVER SAY OR PROVIDE ANY SPECULATIVE COMMENTARY ON WHO I THINK DID WHAT, I WAIT FOR YALL TO DO THAT FOR ME N EVEN THEN I STILL DONT POINT FINGERS THATS NOT MY JOB, THATS THE POLICE JOB TO PUT CASES TOGETHER, MY JOB IS TO DO MURZIK, GIVE YALL THE NEWS N MY TAKE ON IT N ENTERTAIN YALL


THANKS FOR THE 111 SUBS MANE THATS A SIGN FROM GOD I THINK...HE SAYS 'HEY START BELIEVING IN ME AGAIN, SNO WYTE SAID SO' IAIN GOD BUT I KNOW HE NEEDS PPL LIKE ME TO SPEAK FOR HIM SOMETIMES THATS WHY PREACHERS EXIST


WE CAN FIX THIS BETTER THAN THE GOVERNMENT, THE ANSWER ISNT CONFISCATION OR BANNING, IT STARTS WITH WHAT MARILYN MANSON SAID WHEN MICHAEL MOORE SAID 'if u could tell dylan n eric anything right now what would it be?' N HE RESPONDED WITH 'nothing i would do nothing but listen to what they had to say, and i think thats what nobody did' 

GUNS DONT KILL PEOPLE...KILLERS KILL PEOPLE. THE ONLY TIME GUNS KINDA KILL PEOPLE IS WHEN ITS ON ACCIDENT, or a KILLER uses it to kill sum...n killers existed before the gun n will exist after it, u can make ppl not become killers sometimes when they kids by being there for them especially if they look up to u...but not always the first person who ever tried to kill me tried to stab me in the back of the head, and he was also a 7 year old kid. His dad luckily noticed it because i didnt, n stopped him i turnt  when i heard his dad get up n start runnin n saw him standin with an 8"" kitchen knife like  3"" from my skull while i was playin gamecube. Kid heard voices; n that cant be fixed unfortunately sumtimes u cant fix them, them types of killers is like gods form of population control or sum. Cuz either theyll kill a few ppl n go to prison n wont always produce more ppl  or theyll get killed by 'the wrong one' inevitably, i think thats what happened to a few serial killers to be honest.Ôøº

Bloomberg Quicktake,UChirEOpgFCupRAk5etXqPaA,1654050715.0,Memorial for Uvalde Shooting Victims Grows,"It should have been the first day of a joyous week for Robb Elementary School students ‚Äî the start of summer break. Instead, the first two of 19 children slain inside a classroom were being remembered at funeral visitations.

The gathering for 10-year-old Amerie Jo Garza was at Hillcrest Memorial Funeral Home on Monday in Uvalde, Texas, directly across from the grade school where the children, along with two teachers, were shot to death last week before the gunman himself was killed. Visitation for another 10-year-old, Maite Rodriguez, was at the town's other funeral home.

Over the next two-and-a-half traumatic weeks, people in the southwestern Texas town will say goodbye to the children and their teachers, one heart-wrenching visitation, funeral and burial after another.

As family and friends unleash their grief, investigators will push for answers about how police responded to the May 24 shooting, and lawmakers have said they'll consider what can be done to stem the gun violence permeating the nation.

This week alone, funerals are planned for 11 children and teacher Irma Garcia.

CBS Austin,UCT2FAPpgWOGGXtpheDT6jkQ,1654047023.0,Uvalde shooting sparks conversations about Texas gun laws,"The recent tragedy in Uvalde has sparked conversations about if there should be changes to gun laws in Texas.

After last week‚Äôs devastating shooting that killed 19 students and two teachers, people are asking what is being done to prevent that situation from happening again? Depending on who you ask, some say gun control reform is needed.

‚ÄúTexas has some of the weakest gun laws in the country,‚Äù said Nicole Golden with Texas Gun Sense.

Texas gun sense is a nonprofit that advocates for sensible gun laws. Golden says lawmakers should focus on gun control legislation that will increase public safety.

‚ÄúI think I was just afraid that other trans people were going to be harassed because of this. And that ended up happening, which is terrifying. People who don't have the media literacy of understanding what is a trolling campaign are going to read this, and they're going to say that we're evil and they're going to demonize our community far beyond this one photo that was being shared. And I'm just afraid of people, especially in Texas right now, because the government is coming after trans kids.‚Äù 

üì∏  Image Description: An orange, blue, and white blocked background holds an image of Sydney in the center, along with her title, and the above quoted text.

With anti-trans violence and political backlash at all-time highs, award-winning journalist Imara Jones hosts this podcast where trans people and allies talk back about what matters most and discuss how to create a fairer world for all.
