### This Project

This folder contains material from a group final project for my graduate school Data Science I class. For this project, our group analyzed Youtube comment and video data 
regarding showcking news events. Data was collected using the Youtube API, and a Hugging Face model was used to generate sentiment analysis for each comment. The file that
I have included here includes my own data cleaning, analysis, hypothesis testing, and visualization. A full report on the project itself can also be found in this folder, 
along with the data used in this project.
