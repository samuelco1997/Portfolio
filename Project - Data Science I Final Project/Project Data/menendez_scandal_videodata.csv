SHOW NOTES:

Democrat Senator from New Jersey Robert Menendez on multiple charges of corruption and bribery. Damien Williams from the Southern District of New York announces the charges. This isn't Menendez's first rodeo, as he was previously charged under circumstances  over a decade ago. We review the Senator's prior case and the press conference from the Southern District of New York.

#Indictment #Democrat #SDNY

Democrat Senator Bob Menendez is indicted in the Southern District of New York. We review the 39 page indictment, which includes photos of the gold bars Menendez allegedly received along with his internet search history. Does all of this sound familiar? Of course, Biden ran the same scam, except he was smart enough to use his son to handle the cash.

#Bribery #Indictment #Menendez

One House Democrats is calling for Menendez's resignation but being careful to distinguish this case from Joe Biden's bribery allegations. Rep. Dean Phillips shares his opinion on the Menendez news, Chuck Schumer issues a statement and Karine Jean Pierre responds.

OfficialACLJ,UC0AvY8x1GqGIst1C4yygXWw,1695429353.0,Democrat Bob Menendez in Lawfare Crosshairs,"New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez and his wife, Nadine, will be indicted on bribery charges after a raid at the Senator’s home uncovered $100,000 in gold bars and almost $500,000 in cash. A previous indictment against Menendez resulted in a hung jury six years ago, making him the only sitting Senator in U.S. history to be indicted for separate criminal charges.
The bribery charges center on Menendez’s alleged acceptance of bribes from businessmen in his state.
But can we trust the Biden Administration’s DOJ to do a proper job in its investigation? We hate to raise this question, but the Deep State corruption is so prevalent. We’ll keep a close eye on the forthcoming trial.
And who originally prosecuted Menendez six years ago? None other than Special Counsel Jack Smith, the investigator handpicked by Attorney General Merrick Garland to pursue criminal charges against former President Donald Trump. Six years ago, Smith secured an indictment but not a conviction. Will history repeat itself?

New York Post,UCrvhNP_lWuPIP6QZzJmM-bw,1695417300.0,NJ Sen. Bob Menendez hit with federal corruption charges for second time; allegedly took bribes,"New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez has been hit with federal corruption charges related to a years-long scheme in which he allegedly accepted bribes — including gold bars — in exchange for helping three businessmen and the country of Egypt, officials announced Friday.

The Democrat, 69 — and his wife, Nadine Menendez — were charged with taking hundreds of thousands in bribes, according to a Manhattan federal indictment.

This is his second time facing federal corruption charges.

When the feds raided Menendez’s Englewood Cliffs home in June 2022, they found “the fruits” of his “corrupt bribery agreement” including a 2019 Mercedes C-Class, at least 13 gold bars, and $566,000 in cash “stuffed in envelopes.”

The feds say Menendez also received mortgage payments and paid for a low-show or no-show job and home furnishings.

News America Today,UCCEW13bPJH4tHTdJ5Rd7yKQ,1695411395.0,Sen. Bob Menendez and wife indicted on bribery charges,"In this breaking news video, we discuss the recent indictment of New Jersey Democratic Senator Bob Menendez and his wife, Nadine Arslanian Menendez, on bribery charges. This is the second time that Senator Menendez has faced corruption charges in the past 10 years.

According to the U.S. attorney in New York, the indictment is related to the Menendez’s alleged corrupt relationship with three businessmen from New Jersey: Wael Hana, Jose Uribe, and Fred Daibes. The couple has been charged with conspiracy to commit bribery, conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, and conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right.

Prosecutors claim that Menendez and his wife accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for using the senator’s power and influence to protect and benefit these businessmen, as well as the Government of Egypt.

The indictment also reveals that more than $100,000 in gold bars were found at Menendez’s home, allegedly provided by either Hana or Daibes. Pictures of two of these gold bars were included in the indictment.

This is not the first time that Senator Menendez has faced corruption charges. In 2018, he beat allegations of bribery with a hung jury. However, this new indictment raises questions about his previous acquittal.

We will provide you with more details about this indictment during our live press conference coverage, which will be held by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan at 11 a.m. on Friday.

Metaverse Bible Study On YouTube,UC19joipOxkaDbhMR6JXgDNA,1695425447.0,Sen. Bob Menendez and wife indicted on bribery charges | What does the bible say about bribery #cnn,"New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez was charged on Friday with corruption-related offenses for the second time in 10 years.

Menendez and his wife, Nadine Arslanian Menendez, are accused of accepting “hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes” in exchange for the senator’s influence, according to the newly unsealed federal indictment.

Prosecutors allege the bribes included gold, cash, home mortgage payments, compensation for a “low-or-no-show job” and a luxury vehicle.

This is the second set of corruption charges levied against Menendez by the Justice Department in a decade. He previously fought off conspiracy, bribery and honest services fraud related to alleged personal favors.

Menendez is up for reelection next year. He has been in the Senate since 2006.

Senate Democratic Caucus rules will force Menendez to step aside as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, but he can still serve on the panel.

Menendez slammed the indictment in a statement.

What does the bible say about bribery?
7“Stay clear of false accusations. Don’t contribute to the death of innocent and good people. I don’t let the wicked off the hook.
8“Don’t take bribes. Bribes blind perfectly good eyes and twist the speech of good people.
9“Don’t take advantage of a stranger. You know what it’s like to be a stranger; you were strangers in Egypt.

April 1, 2015


New Jersey's Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez made the following statement:

""For nearly three years I've lived under a Justice Department cloud and today I am outraged that this cloud has not been lifted.

""I'm outraged that prosecutors at the Justice Department were tricked into starting this investigation three years ago with false allegations by those who have a political motive to silence me, but I will not be silenced. I'm confident - at the end of the day - I will be vindicated and they will be exposed.

""I began my political career - 40 years ago - fighting corruption in city government. I publicly complained about illegal financial dealings in my city until the FBI investigated and the U.S. Attorney filed corruption charges against the mayor and others. I was called to testify for the prosecution. I received death threats. I wore a bulletproof vest for a month. That's how I began my career in public service. And this is not how my career is going to end.

""I have always conducted myself in accordance with the law. I have always stood up for what's right. I fight for the issues I believe in, the people I represent and for safety and security of this country every single day.

""That's who I am and I'm proud of what I have accomplished. And I'm not going anywhere.

""I'm angry and ready to fight because today contradicts my public service career and my entire life.

""I'm angry because prosecutors at the Justice Department don't know the difference between friendship and corruption and have chosen to twist my duties as a Senator --and as a friend -- into something improper.

""They're dead wrong, and I'm confident they will be proven so.

""I am gratified to live in a country where prosecutors' mistakes can be corrected by courts and juries and I ask my friends, colleagues and community to hold their judgment and remember all the other times where prosecutors have gotten it wrong.

""The people of this great state have elected me to serve and represent their interests in the United States Senate and that is exactly what I will do, no matter how long it takes to clear my good name. New Jersey is my home and I will continue to fight for you.""

The indictment accuses the senator and his wife of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from the businessmen in exchange for using the senator's power and influence to benefit them. 

These bribes allegedly included cash, gold bars, payments toward a home mortgage, compensation for a low-or-no-show job, a luxury vehicle, and other things of value.

Middle East Eye,UCR0fZh5SBxxMNYdg0VzRFkg,1695501965.0,US Senator Robert Menendez indicted on Egypt corruption charges,"US Senator Robert Menendez and his wife, Nadine Arslanian Menendez, were indicted on Friday on charges they took hundreds of thousands of dollars, gold bars, a luxury car and other bribes in exchange for corrupt acts that benefited the government of Egypt.

The indictment comes after a search of the Menendez home in 2022 revealed $100,000 in gold bars and $480,000 in cash, much of it stuffed into envelopes and hidden in clothing, closets and a safe.

A $60,000 Mercedes-Benz convertible gifted to Nadine was part of the corrupt scheme, according to investigators.

""The defendants provided hundreds of thousands of dollars of bribes to Menendez and Nadine Menendez, in exchange for Menendez’s acts and breaches of duty to benefit the Government of Egypt, [New Jersey businessman Wael] Hana, and others, including with respect to foreign military sales and foreign military financing,"" prosecutors said.

OfficialACLJ,UC0AvY8x1GqGIst1C4yygXWw,1695502831.0,REAL Reason Behind Menendez Indictment,"The left will ALWAYS go after one of its own – especially if it helps the party win.
Here’s what I mean by that. The Obama and Biden DOJs were - and are - weaponized against political opponents, and even conservative Americans. The IRS targeting the Tea Party. The DOJ labeling concerned parents at school board meetings as “domestic terrorists.” The DOJ targeting traditional Catholics – something the ACLJ is investigating right now. The list goes on.
But their abuse of the justice system is not contained within partisan lines. The DOJ’s legal arsenal is now being used to indict New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez and his wife on bribery charges. The couple is accused of taking hundreds of thousands in cash, luxury vehicles and even gold bars in exchange for political influence with several New Jersey businessman and the foreign government of Egypt.
And yes, it’s easy to draw comparisons between the Menendez indictment… and the accusations about Joe Biden and his son Hunter. We know the corruption runs deep and two separate standards are applied. But with Menendez, the DOJ wasn’t suddenly struck by an ethically-driven lightning bolt giving them all a sense of duty, honor and justice. So, the question remains, why is the left looking to cannibalize one of its own? And why now?
One possible political motive stands out – if we look at Menendez’s history with the DOJ.
Jack Smith, yes- THAT Jack Smith, indicted Menendez in 2017 on similar corruption and bribery charges and went to trial. After the jury was deadlocked, the DOJ yanked the case in January of 2018 and Menendez went on to handily win re-election in New Jersey.
But let’s go back even further to 2015. Remember Obama’s infamous Iran Nuclear Deal? Menendez was one of four Democrat Senators to vote against it.
Now fast-forward to today, and we find a desperate Biden Administration that just needs a win. And a new deal with Iran is expected to be coming down the pike soon. Except the Democrats’ slim majority in the Senate cannot afford four detractors this time around.
If following this DOJ has taught us anything, it’s this: whenever it APPEARS to be doing its job – like prosecuting real possible corruption – it probably isn’t actually doing its job. There’s likely another politically slanted motivation behind their actions.

Back in the Loop,UCu5RFd8YfpvvyfJoBIkreKQ,1695488596.0,"Bitcoin Critic Senator Menendez Charged With Corruption, Bribery","Senator Menendez, a long-time critic of Bitcoin and other crypto for its alleged association with criminals, faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.


U.S. Senator and Bitcoin skeptic Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) has been charged with bribery after allegedly accepting swaths of gold, cash, and mortgage payments as part of a “corrupt relationship” with three businessmen in his home state. 

The charges follow years of criticism from the politician targeting cryptocurrencies, which he has accused of enabling a range of criminal activities while empowering foreign actors to evade U.S. sanctions. 

“From at least 2018 up to and including in or about 2022, Menendez and his wife, Nadine Menendez, agreed to and did accept hundreds of thousands of dollars of bribes in exchange for using Menendez's power and influence,” read the Friday indictment.


Federal prosecutors allege Menendez helped enrich three businessmen—Wael Hana, Jose Uribe and Fred Daibes—while also benefiting the government of Egypt by providing “sensitive U.S. government information,” among other charges.


For example, prosecutors say Menendez used his influence to dismantle a criminal probe in New Jersey against Uribe, and to protect an Egyptian business monopoly granted to Hana by the Egyptian government that was partly responsible for paying Menendez’s bribes. 

Menendez denied the allegations in a statement. “I remain focused on continuing this important work and will not be distracted by baseless allegations,” he said. All in all, the senator faces three federal charges: conspiracy to commit bribery, conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, and conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right. If convicted, Menendez faces up to 20 years in prison.

According to the indictment, in June 2022, a search warrant against Menendez, his home, and a safe deposit box revealed some of the proceeds from the alleged bribes: over $500,000 in cash, a luxury vehicle, and over $100,000 in gold bars. Prosecutors are seeking the forfeiture of the seized assets.",22,1615,7,27,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zFVFeLCaNq8/hqdefault.jpg,Bob|Meme dex|Menendez|Menedez|Wife|Gold bars|Illuminati|Gold|Senator|Nj|New Jersey|Crimes|Accused|Bitcoin|Crypto|Finance|Phil Murphy|Governor|Jersey|Politics,2023-11-29 11:34:21.315661,2,2023-09-23,2023-09-23 17:03:16

Gingrich 360,UCy1pk0QrYI2dPx21_oRYuSQ,1695495145.0,Senator Bob Menendez Indictment Could Impact a lot of Different Things #news #short,"The report that Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey has been indicted for corruption, apparently literally involving being paid in bars of gold. I mean, who gets paid in bars of gold anymore? But he and his wife have both been indicted. He's been under investigation before. He's engaged in a number of unethical behaviors. He clearly believes in skirting the edge of the law.

This is a significant step, and it will be very interesting to see exactly what happens. Interestingly, here is a case where the Justice Department found somebody who, even though they're a Democrat, was so guilty, I mean, excepting bars of gold, that they felt they had to indict him, even though he's a very senior member of the Senate and a senior Democrat.

So, so big breaking story. I think that it could have a significant impact. He's chair of the Foreign Relations Committee. So it could really impact a lot of different things.

The governor of New Jersey called on Senator Robert Menendez to resign. The senator stepped down from his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee.

Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was charged on Friday with taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes, including bars of gold bullion, to wield his power abroad and at home.

The three-count federal indictment depicted a brazen plan hatched during furtive dinners, in text messages and on encrypted calls — much of it aimed at increasing U.S. assistance to Egypt and aiding businessmen in New Jersey.


Mr. Menendez’s wife, Nadine Menendez, is accused of acting as a go-between, passing messages to an American-Egyptian businessman, Wael Hana, who maintained close connections with Egyptian military and intelligence officials, the indictment said. In one text, to an Egyptian general, Mr. Hana referred to the senator, who held sway over military sales, financing and other aid, as “our man.”

Mr. Menendez, in a strongly worded rebuke to prosecutors, said that he was confident the matter would be “successfully resolved once all of the facts are presented.”

Friday’s charges described an intermingling of the bare-knuckle, back-room dealings of Mr. Menendez’s home state of New Jersey and delicate matters of security in the Middle East. They represent the latest episode in a decades-long political career that took Mr. Menendez, the son of Cuban immigrants, from the Union City, N.J., school board to the halls of the Senate, a career marked by accusations of corruption and an earlier federal indictment that ended in a hung jury.

The Headline Hour,UCjLfGSLdp2YGgQNi4aL4-xg,1695484951.0,Sen. Bob Menendez and His Wife Indicted: Can He Weather the Storm?,"New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez and his wife, Nadine, were indicted on federal bribery charges on Friday, September 23, 2023. The indictment alleges that the couple accepted over $500,000 in bribes from three New Jersey businessmen in exchange for official favors, including lobbying for the businessmen's interests in the Senate.

The indictment is the second against Menendez in recent years. In 2017, he was indicted on corruption charges related to his relationship with a Florida businessman. That trial ended in a mistrial after a jury was unable to reach a verdict.

Menendez has denied all of the charges against him and has vowed to remain in office. However, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy has called on Menendez to resign, saying that the allegations against him have ""severely compromised"" his ability to represent the people of New Jersey.

Murphy's call for resignation

In a statement released on Friday, Murphy said that he was ""deeply disappointed and saddened"" by the allegations against Menendez. He said that the indictment ""casts a cloud over our state"" and that it is ""in the best interest of New Jersey"" for Menendez to resign.

Murphy's call for resignation was echoed by other New Jersey Democrats, including the state's Attorney General, Gurbir Grewal. Grewal said in a statement that the indictment ""paints a picture of corruption and abuse of power.""

Menendez's response

Menendez has denied all of the charges against him and has vowed to remain in office. He said in a statement that he is ""innocent of these charges"" and that he is ""confident that I will be cleared.""

Menendez also accused Murphy of ""playing politics"" and said that he was ""disappointed"" that the governor had called for his resignation.

Impact on the 2024 election

The indictment of Menendez could have a significant impact on the 2024 election. Menendez is up for re-election in 2024, and he is considered to be one of the most vulnerable Democratic senators.

If Menendez is convicted, he would be forced to resign from the Senate. This would trigger a special election to fill his seat, which could be won by a Republican.

Even if Menendez is acquitted, the indictment could damage his reputation and make it more difficult for him to win re-election.

Conclusion

The indictment of Menendez is a major development in New Jersey politics. It is unclear what the long-term impact of the indictment will be, but it has the potential to shake up the 2024 election.

🔥 At a press briefing on Friday, officials claimed that Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) gave 'sensitive' information to Egyptian officials. 

Bob Menendez Charged with 3 Counts, Accused of Accepting ‘Cash, Gold, Home Mortgage Payments’ for Influence

Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and his wife, Nadine Menendez, each face three federal counts stemming from a 39-page indictment alleging they accepted bribes from New Jersey businessmen “in exchange for using Menendez’s power and influence as a Senator” not only to “protect and enrich” the men, but to “benefit the Arab Republic of Egypt.” 

Per a copy of the indictment obtained and published by the New York Times, Menendez faces three counts: Conspiracy to Commit Bribery in violation of Section 201(b)(2)(A) and (C) under Title 18 of the U.S. Code, Conspiracy to Commit Honest Service Fraud under Sections 1343 and 1346 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, and Conspiracy to Commit Extortion Under Color of Official Right under Section 1951(b)(2) and Section 1951(b)(3) of Title 18. The allegations stem from his and Nadine Menendez’s allegedly corrupt relationship with their codefendants, Wael Hana, Jose Uribe, and Fred Daibes.

At a press conference shortly after 11:00 a.m. Eastern, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams laid out allegations of corruption against Menedez and the codefendants between 2018-2022: 

The indictment alleges that through that relationship, the senator and his wife accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars of bribes in exchange for Senator Menendez using his power and influence, to protect and to enrich those businessmen and to benefit the government of Egypt. The indictment alleges that Hana Uribe, and Dabies, provided bribes in the form of cash, gold, home mortgage payments, a low show or no show job for Nadine Menendez, Mercedes Benz and other things of value to the senator and his wife. 
The indictment alleges that Senator Menendez used his power and influence, including his leadership role on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to benefit the government of Egypt in various ways. Among other actions, Senator Menendez allegedly provided sensitive, nonpublic U.S. government information to Egyptian officials and otherwise took steps to secretly aid the government of Egypt. We also allege that Senator Menendez improperly pressured a senior official at the U.S. Department of Agriculture to protect a lucrative monopoly that the government of Egypt had awarded to Hana, a lucrative monopoly that Hana then used to fund certain bribe payments.",25,4,1,,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fX7H8F1-Nyo/hqdefault.jpg,አብይ አህመድ|ጭፍጨፋ|ፀረ-ኢትዮጵያ ሤራ|ጠላት|Abiy Ahmed|ጭካኔ|ጦርነት|ግድያ|ትግራይ|Tigray|War Crimes|የጦር ወንጀል|ጽዮናውያን|Genocide|ግራኝ አህመድ|ወንጀል|Anti-Ethiopia|Rape|አረመኔነት|Aksum|Axum|Massacre|Addis Ababa|አዲስ አበባ|ኤዶማውያን|እስማኤላውያን|Bob Menendez|Egypt|Nile|Renaissance Dam|Indictment|ክስ|Bribes|ሮበርት ሜኔንዴዝ|ሴናቶር|ጉቦ|ግብጽ|አባይ|የሕዳሴ ግድብ,2023-11-29 11:34:21.461963,2,2023-09-23,2023-09-23 13:23:27
NEWS ENGLISH,UCO9AP6-h6jezeE_Y3Akqh2g,1695465599.0,Menendez was charged with conspiracy to commit bribery and embezzlement of property,"The governor of New Jersey called on Senator Robert Menendez to resign. The senator stepped down from his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee.
Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was charged on Friday with taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes, including bars of gold bullion, to wield his power abroad and at home.
The three-count federal indictment depicted a brazen plan hatched during furtive dinners, in text messages and on encrypted calls — much of it aimed at increasing U.S. assistance to Egypt and aiding businessmen in New Jersey.
Mr. Menendez’s wife, Nadine Menendez, is accused of acting as a go-between, passing messages to an American-Egyptian businessman, Wael Hana, who maintained close connections with Egyptian military and intelligence officials, the indictment said. In one text, to an Egyptian general, Mr. Hana referred to the senator, who held sway over military sales, financing and other aid, as “our man.”
Mr. Menendez, in a strongly worded rebuke to prosecutors, said that he was confident the matter would be “successfully resolved once all of the facts are presented.”
Friday’s charges described an intermingling of the bare-knuckle, back-room dealings of Mr. Menendez’s home state of New Jersey and delicate matters of security in the Middle East. They represent the latest episode in a decades-long political career that took Mr. Menendez, the son of Cuban immigrants, from the Union City, N.J., school board to the halls of the Senate, a career marked by accusations of corruption and an earlier federal indictment that ended in a hung jury.",25,3,1,1,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gD0TgL5g-2A/hqdefault.jpg,Menendez was charged with conspiracy to commit bribery and embezzlement of property|menendez was charged with conspiracy to commit bribery and embezzlement of property|conspiracy|menendez|was|charged|with|to|commit|bribery|and|embezzlement|of|property|Menendez Scandal: Conspiracy to Commit Bribery and Embezzlement|The Case Against Menendez: Accusations of Conspiracy and Embezzlement|Conspiracy and Corruption: Menendez's Alleged Wrongdoings Revealed|Conspiracy,2023-11-29 11:34:21.461963,2,2023-09-23,2023-09-23 10:39:59

NY News,UCRw6YTOfcW5_OhfS00pkd1g,1695600370.0,Bob Menendez indictment fallout: Congressman Andy Kim says he plans to run against him | NY News,"WASHINGTON - Andy Kim, a Democratic congressman from New Jersey, said Saturday he will run against newly indicted U.S. Sen Bob Menendez because he refuses to resign over the criminal charges against him.

""After calls to resign, Senator Menendez said 'I am not going anywhere,'"" Kim said on the social media site X. ""As a result, I feel compelled to run against him. Not something I expected to do, but NJ deserves better.""
Calls for Menendez to resign came from several New Jersey Democrats, a group that included Gov. Phil Murphy as well as Kim.

Kim's declaration came a day after a federal grand jury indicted Menendez and his wife on charges of taking bribes that included gold bars, wads of cash, mortgage assistance, and a Mercedes Benz.

Menedez, who did agree to vacate his chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, proclaimed his innocence and attacked those seeking his ouster.

“It is not lost on me how quickly some are rushing to judge a Latino and push him out of his seat,"" Menendez said. ""I am not going anywhere.”

Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said on Friday that Mr Menendez had decided to step down as chairman of the influential committee ""until the matter has been resolved"".
The New York Democrat said his colleague was ""a dedicated public servant and is always fighting hard for the people of New Jersey"".
It is not the first time that Mr Menendez, 69, who has served in Congress since 2006, has had to give up the coveted post on the foreign relations panel.
He also stepped down in 2015 after being indicted in New Jersey on charges that he had accepted bribes from a Florida eye doctor. That case ended in a mistrial after jurors were unable to reach a unanimous verdict.
Maryland Democrat Ben Cardin, who took over as the committee's leading Democrat at the time, is expected again to temporarily ascend to fill the vacancy.
Mr Menendez and his spouse, Nadine Arslanian, are accused of accepting bribes of cash, gold, payments towards a home mortgage and a luxury vehicle from three New Jersey businessmen.
Prosecutors allege the pair accepted the money to secretly aid the Egyptian government and to enrich the three men: Wael Hana, Jose Uribe and Fred Daibes.
According to the 39-page indictment unsealed on Friday, Mr Menendez's leadership position and power as a senator enabled such influence-peddling.
The pair each face three criminal counts: conspiracy to commit bribery, conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, and conspiracy to commit extortion under colour of official right.",25,67,1,0,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/27S2MD_c95o/hqdefault.jpg,bob menendez indictment|bob menendez|indictment|senate foreign relations committee chairman|robert menendez|menendez indictment|senate foreign relations committee|senator bob menendez|menendez|senator menendez|foreign relations committee|sen. bob menendez indictment|sen. bob menendez|sen. robert menendez|nadine menendez|united states senate|us menendez indicted ap explains (cr)|foreign affairs committee|senate|nadine arslanian menendez,2023-11-29 11:34:21.462507,3,2023-09-24,2023-09-24 12:00:03

Democracy Now!,UCzuqE7-t13O4NIDYJfakrhw,1695671114.0,Bob Menendez Indicted: Egypt Tried to Keep U.S. Military Aid Flowing Through Bribery and Corruption,"On Friday, Democratic Senator Bob Menendez and his wife were accused by federal prosecutors of accepting bribes in exchange for using his position to increase U.S. assistance to Egypt and to do favors for three New Jersey businessmen, including Wael Hana, an Egyptian American who ran a lucrative business certifying halal meat exports. “Egypt is a major meat importer,” says Lina Attalah, publisher of the independent Cairo-based news website Mada Masr that investigated the monopolization of halal certification in 2019. “What was straightforward financial corruption had this major political tentacle that affects bilateral relations to a great extent.” Menendez has stepped down as head of the Senate’s Foreign Relations Committee, but as he faces growing pressure to resign from his role as senator, New Jersey-based reporter Bob Hennelly says, the state’s political establishment that enabled him for years now appears ready to let him fend for himself. Democrats “really can’t afford to have Bob Menendez hanging around,” says Hennelly, who reports that Menendez has faced serious corruption charges in the past but retained his Senate seat. “This is what he does.”

RELATED: Sen. Bob Menendez holds news conference https://youtube.com/live/7jFvn5zP-DU

Sen. Bob Menendez wore a bullet-proof vest when, as a young lawyer, he testified against a pair of mob figures and city officials in a corruption case in New Jersey. Now, Menendez himself once again stands accused of political corruption.

The influential New Jersey Democrat was indicted Friday by a federal grand jury in New York and charged with corruption for the second time in eight years. Menendez and his wife, Nadine Arslanian Menendez, are accused of accepting bribes, including cash, gold, mortgage payments and a Mercedes-Benz in a case that alleges the senator used his foreign affairs influence for personal gain.

""As Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) faces criminal charges for bribery along with calls to leave office from his fellow Democrats, one House Republican on Capitol Hill is actually willing to defend him — George Santos.

On Friday, federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York charged the New Jersey lawmaker  along with his wife Nadine Menendez — in connection with three associates in a scheme to benefit the government of Egypt. During a raid on Menendez’s home, three gold bars estimated to be worth $100,000 as well as $480,000 in cash stuffed into various clothing and a safe were found by law enforcement.""

The Humanist Report,UC7Q4rvzJDbHeBHYk5rnvZeA,1695706675.0,The View’s Ana Navarro SHOCKED Her Corrupt Senator Friend Got Indicted Again,"Democratic Senator Bob Menendez was indicted for a second time within the last decade with corruption-related charges. In an episode of ABC’s ‘The View’ Ana Navarro, a long-time friend of the U.S. Senator was “shaken” by the charges, claiming it was hard for her to believe he’d be capable of this level of corruption. She went on to offer a soft defense of Menendez, claiming the “bigger problem” is his wife—who was also indicted—using his name to cash in. In this video we’ll look at her reaction and go over the charges against Menendez.

“The allegations in the indictment against Senator Menendez and four other defendants are deeply disturbing. These are serious charges that implicate national security and the integrity of our criminal justice system,” Murphy said in a statement. “The alleged facts are so serious that they compromise the ability of Senator Menendez to effectively represent the people of our state. Therefore, I am calling for his immediate resignation.”

The public statements by Murphy and state political leaders puts intense, possibly undeniable, pressure on New Jersey’s senior senator even after he struck a defiant tone in response to the allegations. Menendez is up for reelection in 2024 and had said before the charges that he would seek another term.""

 'For 30 years,' Menendez said, 'I have withdrawn thousands of dollars in cash from my personal savings accounts, which I have kept for emergencies and because of the history of my family facing confiscation in Cuba.' Under an indictment unsealed last week, Menendez and his wife, Nadine Menendez, 56, were accused of using his seat in the Senate, as chair of the foreign relations committee, to benefit the government of Egypt.

Associated Press,UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA,1695677486.0,LIVE | Senator Bob Menendez delivers remarks following indictment,"Sen. Bob Menendez will deliver remarks from Union City, New Jersey, days after he and his wife were indicted on bribery charges. 

The Democratic senator was accused of secretly aiding the authoritarian government of Egypt and trying to thwart the criminal prosecution of a friend in exchange for gold bars and cash.

Menendez was forced to relinquish his chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee but said he would not resign from Congress, though New Jersey’s governor, a fellow Democrat, and other Democrats in the state’s congressional delegation said he should.

USA TODAY,UCP6HGa63sBC7-KHtkme-p-g,1695675106.0,Watch live: Sen. Bob Menendez holds news conference,"Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., is facing heavy pressure from Democratic and Republican colleagues to resign following a sprawling indictment that alleges the New Jersey Democrat accepted bribes and leveraged his position to engage in corruption. 

As the calls for him to resign get louder, Menendez has remained defiant, denying the indictment’s allegations and saying in a statement he is “not going anywhere.” Menendez’s resistance motivated Rep. Andy Kim, D-N.J., to mount a primary challenge against him. 

“After calls to resign, Senator Menendez said 'I am not going anywhere.' As a result, I feel compelled to run against him,” Kim said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, announcing his Senate bid. ""Not something I expected to do, but (New Jersey) deserves better. We cannot jeopardize the Senate or compromise our integrity.”

Bob Menendez has been hit with federal corruption charges related to a years-long scheme in which he allegedly accepted bribes – including gold bars – in exchange for helping three businessmen and the country of Egypt, officials announced Friday.

The Democrat, 69 — and his wife Nadine Menendez — were charged with taking hundreds of thousands worth in bribes, according to a Manhattan federal indictment.

Menendez gave a lengthy statement in English and Spanish from his longtime political stomping ground of Union City, NJ.

In addition to denying the charges, the senator tried to explain the cash that was found when federal agents searched his home earlier this year.

""For 30 years, I have withdrawn thousands of dollars in cash from my personal savings account, which I have kept for emergencies and because of the history of my family facing confiscation in Cuba,"" he says. ""This may seem old-fashioned, but these were monies drawn from my personal savings account based on the income that I have lawfully derived over those 30 years.""

CNN-News18,UCef1-8eOpJgud7szVPlZQAQ,1695719902.0,US News Today | Robert Menendez: US Senator Vows He Will Be Cleared In Bribery Case | N18V,"A US senator charged in a bribery case has said his stashing of nearly half a million dollars cash at home stemmed from his Cuban parents' fear that their savings might be seized by authorities.

Robert Menendez of New Jersey predicted he would be exonerated as he vowed to run for re-election next year.

Prosecutors say he and his wife accepted money, gold bars and a luxury car in exchange for political favours.

The senator has so far rejected calls from fellow Democrats to resign.

Senator Bob Menendez is no stranger to corruption allegations, but the indictment unveiled against him Friday marks extraordinary new lows for one of the Senate's most powerful members. Facing charges for the second time in his decades-long career, Menendez now deals with accusations that should shame even the most jaded observers of Washington politics.

There are just five days left before a potential government shutdown. What is the latest in GOP negotiations, and what does a messaging campaign by the White House say about who should bear the blame?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fetterman Urges Menendez to Make an ‘Honorable Exit’ and Resign.
Pennsylvania Democrat U.S. Sen. John Fetterman called on Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., to resign following a federal indictment.

Menendez is being charged with conspiracy to commit bribery, conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, and conspiracy to commit extortion under color of an official right.

""Senator Menendez should resign. He’s entitled to the presumption of innocence under our system, but he is not entitled to continue to wield influence over national policy, especially given the serious and specific nature of the allegations. I hope he chooses an honorable exit and focuses on his trial,"" Fetterman said in a statement on Saturday.

The New Jersey Democrat thus far has pushed back on calls for his resignation, which include his home state's governor, Democrat Phil Murphy.

""Those who believe in justice believe in innocence until proven guilty. I intend to continue to fight for the people of New Jersey with the same success I’ve had for the past five decades,"" he said. ""This is the same record of success these very same leaders have lauded all along. It is not lost on me how quickly some are rushing to judge a Latino and push him out of his seat. I am not going anywhere,"" Menendez said on Saturday.

The senator earlier said that prosecutors misrepresented the normal work of a Congressional office"" and are attempting to ""dig my political grave."" 

""The excesses of these prosecutors is apparent. They have misrepresented the normal work of a Congressional office. On top of that, not content with making false claims against me, they have attacked my wife for the longstanding friendships she had before she and I even met,"" Menendez said.

U.S. Attorney Damian Williams announced the indictment Friday morning at a press conference.

""Today, I'm announcing that my office has obtained a three count indictment charging Senator Robert Menendez, his wife, Nadine Menendez, and three New Jersey businessmen, Wael Hana, Jose Uribe and Fred Daibes for bribery offenses,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said at a press conference on Friday morning. 

According to the indictment, the couple accepted ""hundreds of thousands of dollars of bribes in exchange for using Menendez's power and influence as a senator to seek to protect and enrich Hana, Uribe, and Daibes and to benefit the Arab Republic of Egypt."" 

Menendez allegedly gave sensitive U.S. government information to Hana, who's an Egyptian-American businessman, who ""secretly aided the Government of Egypt.""

The alleged bribes included gold, cash, payments toward a mortgage, compensation for a low-or-no-show job, a luxury car, and ""other things of value.""

Menendez had disclosed his family accepted gold bars in 2020.

Menendez also allegedly pressured an official at the Department of Agriculture with the goal of protecting a business monopoly granted to Hana by the Egyptian government.

In return, Hana allegedly kicked back profits from the monopoly to Menendez, the indictment states.",22,6,1,,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ouePZI6nrG4/hqdefault.jpg,former president|desantis|president|midterm election|midterm elections|reaction|question|midterm elections 2022|ron desantis|kristen walker|election polls|nbc news reporter|biden|trump|2024 election|election|florida governor|joe biden|government|conservative|election 2022|midterm elections 2022 candidates|politics|midterms|donald trump|midterm election in usa|voters|primary|republican|fun|news|polls|voter|victory|nowthis|reporter|watch,2023-11-29 11:34:21.935432,4,2023-09-25,2023-09-25 13:42:45

Bob Menendez (D-NJ) to resign is growing, now including over a dozen of his democratic colleagues, but Senator Menendez has vowed he will not leave office. Andrea Mitchell is joined by former New Jersey Congressman Tom Malinowski to discuss the impact of these allegations and who might be the best contender to primary Menendez in 2024. “We can't go out and tell the American people to be troubled by Donald Trump's indictments and not to vote for him and then turn around and say but ignore this when it happens to a powerful person in our own party. So yes, it is time,” Malinowski says. On whether he will run for Senate, he says “I have not made that decision. I think all of us right now have been trying to unite around a common call that he should resign.”

NJ Sen. Bob Menendez press conference to address corruption charges | NY News Network

Fetterman wants to give back Menendez donations in 'envelopes stuffed with $100 bills'

Sen. John Fetterman isn't giving fellow Democrat Bob Menendez a break after calling on his New Jersey colleague to resign amid a major federal indictment that alleges corruption and bribery.

Fetterman, who represents Pennsylvania, is the only Democratic senator thus far who has called on Menendez to step down over charges that he and his wife received cash, gold bars, mortgage payments and a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for enriching the Egyptian government.

Menendez vehemently denied those claims on Monday during a press conference in Union City, New Jersey, promising he would be ""exonerated"" when all the facts come out.

But Fetterman pressed the issue further when his office said the freshman lawmaker plans to return a $5,000 donation Menendez made during the 2022 campaign, “in envelopes stuffed with $100 bills,” a Fetterman spokesperson told The Messenger, an online news outlet.

Documents from the investigation show FBI agents had found roughly $480,000 in cash, much of it stuffed into envelopes and hidden in clothing, when executing a search warrant at Menendez's home.

Menendez said Monday he often withdraws thousands of dollars of cash from his personal savings account to keep for emergencies.

Fetterman's office did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.

Last week, Fetterman said Menendez is ""entitled to the presumption of innocence"" but that his colleague isn't granted the right to ""continue to wield influence over national policy, especially given the serious and specific nature of the allegations.""

Other Democratic officials, including New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, have also said it's time for Menendez to go in the days since the indictment became public.

""Menendez must resign. Corruption is corruption. Bribery is bribery,"" Rep. Summer Lee, D-Pa., said Monday in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.

""We can't hold Thomas (and) Alito accountable for selling out our freedoms for luxury vacations if we can't hold a senator accountable for selling out his chairmanship to a dictator gifting gold for military aid.""",25,732,1,3,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Cbl9-0eloo/hqdefault.jpg,bob menendez|bribery|new jersey|bob menendez charges|bob menendez indictment|senator bob menendez|Fetterman|Menendez|Menendez donations|John Fetterman|Bob Menendez|New Jersey|corruption and bribery|Mercedes-Benz|Pennsylvania|Egyptian government|Union City|freshman lawmaker|FBI agents|FBI|Menendez's home|USA TODAY|national policy|New Jersey Gov.|Phil Murphy|Summer Lee|D-Pa|Thomas|Alito|military aid|NY News Network|ny news|live news|news live,2023-11-29 11:34:22.049361,5,2023-09-26,2023-09-26 22:43:15

Senator Menendez Faces Bribery Charges in Indictment

The U.S. Justice Department has taken a significant step in the case against Senator Bob Menendez, a Democrat representing New Jersey, and his wife. 

They have been formally indicted on bribery charges, marking a significant development in the ongoing investigation. 

NBC News' Ken Dilanian has delved into the details of the charges, shedding light on the allegations against the senator.

The charges against Senator Menendez revolve around accusations of accepting illicit payments in the form of both cash and gold bars. 

The indictment alleges that Menendez used his political influence to benefit a wealthy donor, accepting substantial bribes in return. 

These alleged bribes are believed to have spanned a considerable period, potentially compromising the integrity of his public office.

While the exact details of the payments remain under investigation, the charges have raised serious questions about potential misconduct within the political sphere.

It is expected that this case will renew discussions about campaign finance reform and the influence of money in politics.

As the legal proceedings against Senator Menendez and his wife unfold, the public and the political world will be closely watching.

STORYLINE:
U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and his wife were indicted Friday on charges that they took bribes of cash, gold bars and a luxury car for a range of corrupt acts, including having the Democrat use his influence over foreign affairs to benefit the authoritarian government of Egypt.

 The sweeping indictment alleges that Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, provided sensitive and non-public U.S. government information to Egyptian government officials and took other steps to secretly help Egypt, including ghost-writing a letter on behalf of Egypt pushing other senators to lift a hold on $300 million in aid to the country.

Authorities also allege the senator sought to derail a criminal investigation into an associate by pushing for a U.S. attorney nominee he believed could be influenced. 

 A search of the couple’s home turned up $100,000 in gold bars and $480,000 in hidden cash, said prosecutors, who announced the charges against the 69-year-old Democrat nearly six years after an earlier criminal case against him ended with a deadlocked jury.

 The latest indictment is unrelated to the earlier charges that alleged Menendez accepted lavish gifts to pressure government officials on behalf of a Florida doctor.

Democracy Now!,UCzuqE7-t13O4NIDYJfakrhw,1695930035.0,Senator Bob Menendez Pleads Not Guilty As Calls Grow for Resignation,"Senator Bob Menendez appeared in court Wednesday to face corruption charges yet refused to resign. A growing number of politicians have called for Menendez to step down, after federal agents discovered large amounts of cash, gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz in the Democrat’s New Jersey home. “There’s a possibility that this cycle that we see will not recur,” says David Dayen, executive editor of The American Prospect, who says even the New Jersey political machine is “shunning” Menendez after his second corruption indictment in less than 10 years.

Al Jazeera English,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,1695924532.0,US Senator Bob Menendez pleads not guilty to corruption charges,"Top United States Senator Bob Menendez has pleaded not guilty to corruption charges amid growing calls for his resignation.
Menendez entered his not-guilty plea in federal court in New York on Wednesday, just days after the Democratic Party legislator expressed confidence that he would be exonerated in the criminal case.
The senator’s four co-defendants – his wife Nadine Menendez and businessmen Jose Uribe, Fred Daibes and Wael Hana – also pleaded not guilty this week.
So far, Menendez has temporarily withdrawn from his role as chair of the influential Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, but he has vowed to fight the charges against him.
Prosecutors say Menendez accepted thousands of dollars from three New Jersey businessmen, to secretly help the Egyptian government.

Al Jazeera’s Gabriel Elizondo reports from New York.

Bob Menendez, the son of Cuban immigrants, never lost his focus on New Jersey’s Latino constituency, and in return, was given its unwavering support. This week, many in that constituency refused to echo demands from leading Democrats for their favorite son to step down in the wake of a criminal indictment on corruption charges.

New York Post,UCrvhNP_lWuPIP6QZzJmM-bw,1695942568.0,NJ Sen. Bob Menendez’s wife totes Chanel purse to NYC court as couple pleads not guilty,"New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez’s wife toted a pricey Chanel purse to Manhattan federal court Wednesday as she and her embattled husband pleaded not guilty to pocketing bribes — including cash and $100,000 in gold bars. NY Post Senior Court Reporter Ben Kochman shares this story. 

The veteran Democrat, 69, and his 56-year-old wife, Nadine, strolled out of the Lower Manhattan courthouse following their brief first hearing in the sweeping corruption case — with Menendez’s spouse getting slapped with stricter bail conditions.

Facing mounting calls from fellow Dems to resign, Menendez, wearing a dark pinstriped suit, sat with his hands tightly clasped in his lap as he was ordered released on a $100,000 bond.

Magistrate Judge Ona Wang ordered him to surrender any personal passports, but said the senator could still travel outside the US for official government purposes while his case is pending.

Meanwhile, his wife — who prosecutors allege played a key role in collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes — was ordered to be released on a $250,000 bond secured by the couple’s Englewood Cliffs, NJ, home.

Democratic Senator Bob Menendez is refusing to step down after he was indicted for a massive bribery and political corruption scheme. The senator is accused of using his position to secure special treatment for his friends in Egypt in exchange for cash and gifts, totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars. Joining me to talk about that is the best guy in the progressive business. Farron Cousins can always bring information that matters. Farron, this story is shocking. This is the second time in 10 years for Bob and he barely escaped last time, but the facts are basically the same facts, the same mo except this time he's got his wife involved in the business, right?
Yeah. His wife, when you look through this indictment, it almost seems like she's the one who set a lot of this in motion. She introduced him to her friends from Egypt and then, oh, well, we need some favors, and you're the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And from there it just snowballed into this massive pay to play, really?
Yeah.
He was getting gifts. I mean.
Here's the list. $450,000 in just gold around there. Gold bars that have fingerprints of the cats who gave it to him. Cash, what, $500,000 in cash sewn into his clothes. Stuffed under the mattress. Hidden in the wife's jewelry. On top of that, what is it, he gets, they're making house payments for him. He gets a Mercedes. And the guy's taking the position, oh, I'm just a victim because I'm Latino. I mean, isn't that revolting? Isn't that disgusting? Rather than just saying, look, you know what, I got caught. You know, he comes from, what is it called, a union city up in New Jersey, A big mob area, by the way. So he's learned the mob business and he's pretty good at it, apparently. What do you think?
Look, he has no choice at this point, but to resign. You do finally have more and more Democratic senators that have come out this week that said, yes, obviously he deserves the presumption of innocence till trial, but he's gotta get outta the Senate. And that's absolutely true. And when you look, obviously he does deserve the presumption of innocence, but I mean, he pretty much had everything except for big bags with dollar signs on them in his house.
With film of them. Here it is.
I mean, gold bars. We're talking about real cartoon villain here. Money just popping out of his jackets, he had so much of it.
He's got the same criminal lawyer that Hunter Biden has, and I know Lowell. I mean, he ain't, he is not a magician. And that's what you'd have to be on here. His position, well, I just saved cash, not on $180,000 a year, is what he's making. His wife had a no-show job that was also part of the deal. So between them, if they're making $250,000, he's got almost $500,000 in cash. He's got 400, gold bars that are worth $150,000. And then you add all this stuff that's in addition to that. And I don't know whether he has much of a defense. Now, if it's tried in New Jersey, he might, because they're used to trying cases, mobster type cases up there. But there was something that struck me about this. This came on the, the week before the DOJ got absolutely obliterated in hearings, I thought, because the answers to some of the questions weren't good. Not that the questions were so smart, but the answers to the question about some of what the DOJ's been up to. What did they do in this situation? Why did they fail to do this and this? It looked bad, the totality of it. But this comes the week after that. And you gotta say, I wonder, is this DOJ rehab, you think?
It might be, but we also gotta talk about what he did.",25,10582,90,1040,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kWIJXKZIFWU/hqdefault.jpg,the ring of fire|progressive news|trofire|politics|the young turks|tyt|politics today|us news|breaking news|rof|mike papantonio|america's lawyer|farron cousins|bob menendez|menendez bribery|menendez egypt|menendez indictment|menendez doj|menendez resign|menendez wife|senator menendez|menendez gold bars,2023-11-29 11:34:22.247864,8,2023-09-29,2023-09-29 20:00:43

""Many Republicans and even some Democrats have called for the resignation of Sen.

But ex-president Donald Trump wants to expand that to include every Democrat in the United States Senate.

On his Truth Social platform on Sunday, Trump raged in a post that it’s not just Menendez who is guilty and must step down, but every Senate Democrat.

“Senate Democrats should all resign based on Senator Bob Menendez!” he wrote. “They all knew what was going on, and the way he lived.”""

STORYLINE:
Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey defiantly pushed back against federal corruption charges and the erosion of Democratic support in his home state Monday, saying cash authorities found in his home was from his savings account and on hand for emergencies. 

He said that he believed he'd be exonerated and that prosecutors sometimes get the facts wrong. 

Addressing allegations in the indictment unsealed Friday that authorities found cash stuffed in envelopes and clothing at his home, Menendez said the funds were draw from his personal savings account and stemmed his parents fear of confiscation of funds from their time in Cuba. 

In Washington, where the U.S. Senate is closely divided, some of Menendez’s Democratic colleagues have stopped short of calling for his resignation, notably Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, and Majority Whip Dick Durbin, of Illinois.  

Menendez has, however, stepped down as chairman of the influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Schumer said on Friday, when the indictment was unsealed. 

Menendez has denied any wrongdoing in the federal case against him, his wife and three of their business associates. 

He and his wife, Nadine Menendez, are accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, gold and a luxury car from a trio of New Jersey businessmen for a variety of corrupt acts.

RESTRICTION SUMMARY:

ASSOCIATED PRESS
Washington - 27 September 2023
 1. Wide of Sen. Chuck Schumer walking to microphone
2. SOUNDBITE: (English) Sen. Chuck Schumer, Majority Leader:
""Like you, I was just deeply disappointed, disturbed when I read the indictment. Look, I've known Senator (Bob) Menendez a very long time, and it was truly, truly upsetting. But we all know that senators, for senators, there's a much, much higher standard. And clearly, when you read the indictment, Senator Menendez fell way, way below that standard. Tomorrow, he will address the Democratic caucus and we'll see what happens after that. 
(Reporter, off-camera: Should he resign?) 
""As I said, tomorrow he will address our caucus and we'll see what will happen after that.""
3. Cutaway of reporters
STORYLINE:
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he was ""deeply disturbed"" and ""disappointed"" when he read the criminal indictment of Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez and the New Jersey senator's wife, Nadine.  

Menendez left court without speaking to reporters after pleading not guilty to federal charges accusing him of pocketing bribes of cash and gold bars. Prosecutors say in exchange Menendez wielded his political influence to secretly advance Egyptian interests and do favors for local businessmen. Menendez appeared Wednesday in Manhattan’s federal court. Lawyers for Menendez and his wife, entered not guilty pleas for them.

Schumer, in remarks hours after Menendez's court appearance, did not call for Menendez to resign and said Menendez would address his Democratic colleagues on Thursday. “We all know that senators -- for senators, there’s a much much higher standard. And clearly, when you read the indictment, Sen. Menendez fell way, way below that standard,” said Schumer, D-N.Y.

The senator was ordered released on a $100,000 bond, and he must surrender any personal passports but will be allowed to keep an official passport that would allow him to travel outside the U.S. for government business.

Calls for Menendez to resign continued to mount on Wednesday with Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, saying “he should step down.” More than half of Senate Democrats have now said that Menendez should resign, including fellow New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker.

RESTRICTION SUMMARY:

ASSOCIATED PRESS
Washington – 28 September 2023
1. SOUNDBITE (English), Sen. Roger Marshall, (R), Kentucky: 
Reporter: “And really quickly on Senator Menendez, do you think he should step down, given the indictment?” 
Marshall: “You know, I really don't have an opinion on that. My job is to try to figure out how to balance the budget right now. I think there's more questions than answers, and we'll just have to let him and his own party figure out what's best to do that.” 
2. Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman walking toward the press
3. SOUNDBITE (English), Sen. John Fetterman, (D), Pennsylvania: 
Reporter: “Have you heard from him at lunch? Did you even go? Did you even attend?”
Fetterman: “I didn't go to the lunch. I refused to because the only thing that if he has something to say, it's like, you know, he's resigning. That's the only honorable expert. I shouldn't exist. And he's got to go. He's got to go. I can't imagine, you know, how he could possibly explain any of that kind of a thing. But that's him to do in the court, not here among us. He needs to go.”
Reporter: “Are there any questions he could answer for you? Any questions you might want to ask him?”
Fetterman: “Why haven't you resigned already? You know, like. And it's just like. It's crazy. And right now it's arrogance. Now, this is how many how many trips to the dance he's had on this kind of thing, You know, like, and if this kind, you know, confronting him at the last time. We wouldn't be having this conversation right now. I mean, it's a pattern. And he really needs to decide to resign.”
Reporter: “Should Schumer call on him to resign?”
Fetterman: “I mean, it's the leader's choice. But, you know, I've been very free and I've been very clear on how I feel on that as well.”
Reporter: “It sounds like Senator Menendez told colleagues in lunch he will not resign, that he intends to be the New Jersey senior senator showing up here to vote, participating in committee hearings. Do you think it's a matter of national security?”
Fetterman: “You know, this idea that you're not going anywhere, it's like, no you are. It's either going to be an election or it's going to be a conviction, you know, or it's just not going to happen. You know, he clearly he's not going to have an honorable exit at this point, But it's going to one of those two ways, an election or a conviction.” 
Reporter: “Are you surprised that he's kind of holding his ground here?”
Fetterman: “No, I'm not. I mean, that's the thing. I mean, I guess that's the way it feels. Like that's the only way to handle it. Because at this point, if a sense of honor, I don't think it would have put him in this situation in the first place.”
4. Virginia Senator Tim Kaine walking toward the press
5. SOUNBIDTE (English), Sen. Tim Kaine, (D), Virginia: 
Reporter: “So, what made of the Democrat lunch and what you heard from your colleague, Senator Menendez?” 
Kaine: “You know, I'm not ready to talk about it. I'm still processing it.” 
Reporter: “Could you tell us what kind of the order of events that happened?” 
Kaine: “You know the two topics were obviously that up to date on where the negotiations are in terms of getting our Senate bipartisan budget bill done. And then Senator Menendez addressed us. There wasn't Q&A or anything like that, but I don't really want to talk about it.”
Reporter: “Do you feel like he should resign?”
Kaine: “I've answered that question already. The charges are disqualifying if true. But anybody who is facing a charge in our system gets to contest the charge.”

Bob Menendez (D-NJ) has faced calls from fellow Democrats to resign from Congress. But in his own backyard, top Hudson County Democrats have given only measured comment. Progressives in Hudson County say the reluctance of local party leaders to demand Menendez resign is an egregious example of a larger issue.
